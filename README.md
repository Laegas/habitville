## Description

Hobby project to gamify habits. Create actions in line with habits you'd like to achieve for yourself, mark their completition, get rewards and spend those rewards and building your ville!

## Why?

I couldn't find an app that would scratch the itch and find the right balance between the flexibility of creating whichever actions instead of choosing from a predefined list of actions and being rewarded for completing the actions and seeing those rewards turn into development of something external where, for me, as I always enjoyed tycoon games, it's developing a ville.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
